# Cache-memory-simulation
We have a structure / class that will contain a tag, c. They would have one structure that would simulate the data part of the cache and one text file with which to simulate the working disk. We would enter the address from the standard input and then the program would return the appropriate data. The data format on the disk would be aaaa: dd.
